# SIRDS
This directory contains our epidemiological agent-based model for the spread of infectious diseases (SIRD.pyx). The bash file (run_SIRD.sh) shows how to convert this script to an executable file (SIRDS.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so), while the script execute.py shows how to call and run the script.
