# GBM
This directory contains our cellular automata (CA) model for tumour growths (ABM.pyx). The bash file (run_ABM.sh) shows how to convert this script to an executable file (GBM.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so), while the script execute.py shows how to call and run the script.

The folder DIST contains summaries of the test data, whilst the folder GRID contains the scripts needed for constructing large grids of simulations. The folders EMULATION and INFERENCE contain scripts for machine learning algorithms that allow constructing surrogate models and direct inference machines, respectively.
