# Content

This folder contains several files for training the different machine learning resources for creating surrogate models: neural networks (NN.py), Mixture Density Networks (MDN.py), and Gaussian Processes (GP.py). In addition, the folder contains means to compare the trained emulators to test data (make_comparison.py) as well as scripts for inference based on data (ABC/rej.py and MCMC/mcmc_all.py).
